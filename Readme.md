# ToDo Application with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This repository contains code samples for building a simple ToDo application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on ToDo items.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JavaScript

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

     ```plaintext
     MONGODB_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
     PORT=<port-number>
     ```

     Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your MongoDB connection string and `<port-number>` with the desired port number for running the server.

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Code Explanation

The code is divided into several files:

1. `server.js`: This file sets up the Express server, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines routes.

2. `routes/ToDoRoute.js`: This file contains route definitions for CRUD operations on ToDo items.

3. `controllers/ToDoController.js`: This file contains controller functions for handling CRUD operations.

4. `models/ToDoModel.js`: This file defines the Mongoose schema for a ToDo item and exports it as a Mongoose model.

## Routes

- `GET /`: Fetches all ToDo items.
- `POST /save`: Saves a new ToDo item.
- `POST /update`: Updates an existing ToDo item.
- `POST /delete`: Deletes an existing ToDo item.
